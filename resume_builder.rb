I'm Maxwell, recent Dev Bootcamp Grad and full-stack developer. A little about me: I'm a creative guy, in love with technology and puzzles (especially Rubik's cubes).
I left a successful career in the entertainment industry to pursue my passion for programming. For the past year and a half, I've been coding day and night with increasing success, both because of my love for problem solving and my persistent drive to learn new things. I'm hungry, driven, smart and yes... green. But what I lack in experience I make up for with hard work, enthusiasm and a knack for picking up new concepts.

I think I would be a great fit for #{company} based on what I can tell about the culture of your company and your use of new technologies. I’m passionate and detail oriented; I won’t sleep till the job is done right. I hope you will give me the chance to be a part of your team and help create the next generation of #{company} tools.

I'm looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Maxwell"
